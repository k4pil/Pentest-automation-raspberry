# Offloading Resource-Intensive Tasks to Raspberry Pi (or IoT Devices) Using SSH

This Python script empowers you to offload computationally intensive tasks to a Raspberry Pi or other IoT devices connected to your network, all via SSH. By utilizing this script, you can automate remote task execution and reduce the burden on your primary system.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Python 3.x
- [paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/) library (install with `pip install paramiko`)
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library (install with `pip install python-dotenv`)
- SSH access to the target Raspberry Pi or IoT device with appropriate permissions

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Create a virtual environment (venv) to isolate project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

     OR

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

4. Create a `.env` file within the project directory with the following structure:

   ```plaintext
   server=your_server_hostname
   port=your_ssh_port
   user=your_ssh_username
   password=your_ssh_password
   ssh_public_key=your_public_key_path  # (Only if using public key authentication; use forward slashes for paths on Windows)
   ```

   Replace `your_server_hostname`, `your_ssh_port`, `your_ssh_username`, `your_ssh_password`, and `your_public_key_path` with the actual server details and authentication methods for your Raspberry Pi or IoT device. On Windows, use forward slashes (`/`) in the `ssh_public_key` path.

5. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Standalone Python Script

Execute the script from the command line, specifying the desired command and its arguments:

```bash
python3 run.py -b <base command> -a <arguments> [-s] [-n] [-p]
```

- `-b <base command>`: The core command you wish to execute remotely (e.g., `python`, `ffmpeg`, `curl`).
- `-a <arguments>`: Additional arguments or options to accompany the base command.

Optional Flags:

- `-s` or `--save-output-remote`: Save the command output to a file on the remote device.
- `-n` or `--no-output-local`: Do not display the output in the terminal (useful for background tasks).
- `-p` or `--use-public-key-remote`: Use public key authentication for the SSH connection (requires specifying `ssh_public_key` in the `.env` file).

This will run the `my_script.py` Python script on the Raspberry Pi or IoT device and display the output.

### Flask app

From the root project directory simply run the command:

```bash
python3 ./flask_app/app.py
```

## Features

- **SSH Connectivity**: The script securely establishes an SSH connection with the remote Raspberry Pi or IoT device.

- **Command Verification**: It checks if the specified base command is available on the target device before execution.

- **Remote Execution**: Offload compute-intensive tasks to the remote device, freeing up resources on your primary system.

## Note

- Ensure that you possess valid SSH access rights and permissions for command execution on the Raspberry Pi or IoT device.

- Exercise caution when utilizing this script, especially with potentially resource-intensive tasks, to avoid overloading the remote device.
